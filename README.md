# Loss-optimising-loan-recovery-decision-times-using-forecast-cash-flows
A theoretical method is empirically illustrated in finding the best time to forsake a loan such that the overall credit loss is minimised. This is predicated by forecasting the future cash flows of a loan portfolio up to the contractual term, as a remedy to the inherent right-censoring of real-world `incomplete' portfolios. Two techniques, a simple probabilistic model as well as an eight-state Markov chain, are used to forecast these cash flows independently. In devising a comparative experimental framework, both techniques are parametrised from different segments within residential mortgage data prior forecasting, which is provided by a large South African bank. As a result, the recovery decision's implied timing is empirically illustrated as a multi-period optimisation problem across uncertain cash flows and competing costs. Using a delinquency measure as a central criterion, the procedure helps find a loss-optimal threshold at which loan recovery should ideally occur for a given portfolio (or segment). Furthermore, both the portfolio's historical risk profile and forecast thereof are shown to influence the timing of the recovery decision. This work can therefore facilitate the revision of relevant bank policies or strategies towards optimising the loan collections process, especially that of secured lending.
